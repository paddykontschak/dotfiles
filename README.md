dotfiles
===

These are my dotfiles.

"Dependencies"
---

* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)
* RVM
* NPM
* git
* vim
* irssi
* irb
* MacIRB/DietIRB
* [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate)

To be honest, nothing is going to break if you don't have all of these.

Installation
---

I suggest you install these configurations with Joshua Nichols' [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

    homesick clone git://github.com/paddykontschak/dotfiles.git
    homesick pull dotfiles
    homesick symlink dotfiles
